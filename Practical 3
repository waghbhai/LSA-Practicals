              Practical No.3

NFS stands for Network File System which is basically developed for sharing of files and folders between Linux/Unix systems.
It allows you to mount your local file systems over a network and remote hosts to interact with them as they are mounted locally on the same system. 
With the help of NFS, we can set up file sharing between Unix to Linux system and Linux to Unix system.


Steps and Commands:

To install NFS kernel 

-> sudo apt-get -y install nfs-kernel-server

To enable or active nfs kernel server

->sudo systemctl enable nfs-kernel-server

Now, Create a Directory to show the function of nfs i.e mounting

->mkdir tycs_a
->touch r.txt
->cat /etc/exports

Configure your exports file by adding /directory_path/ ipaddr (permissions)

->sudo exportfs -ra

->sudo apt-get -y install nfs-common

->sudo mount -t nfs /directorytoexport client_ip_ntwrk (permissions) 

Check for the mounted file in the directory
