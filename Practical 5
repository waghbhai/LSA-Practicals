       Practical No.5




Samba is an open-source software suite that runs on 
Unix/Linux based platforms but is able to communicate
with Windows clients like a native application.
So Samba is able to provide this service by employing 
the Common Internet File System (CIFS).

Command to install samba:

Install the samba package
-> sudo apt-get update
-> sudo apt-get install samba

Create a directory for it to share
-> mkdir /home/kali/sambashare/

-> sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

Add this to the end of the file.
[sambashare]
    comment = Samba on Ubuntu
    path = /home/username/sambashare
    read only = no
    browsable = yes

Start/Restart the service
-> sudo service smbd restart

Allow samba through the firewall
-> sudo ufw allow samba

Setting up User Account
-> sudo smbpasswd -a kali
Note: Username must belong to the system account.

For Windows, Open the file explorer and type \\ip-address\sambashare

          OR
          
To test on your local machine
   smb://ip-address/sambashare
